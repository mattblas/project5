# project5

This project is a kind of game that is a combination of real life climbing and online competition. On the one hand, we have an interface of administrators who are responsible for adding new climbing routes, editing existing ones and summarizing the results. On the other hand, there are users who, after logging in, can add the climbing routes they have covered, rate and comment on them.

The application counts and displays the current results. The results are divided into age categories, gender categories and open category.

The final score is the sum of points earned by completing the climbing routes, but only points for the last three months are counted.
